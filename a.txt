Client-Server Architecture is a design pattern used in computer networks to distribute resources and tasks between two main types of systems:

1. **Client**: A device that requests or provides services, such as a user's computer, mobile device, or web browser.
2. **Server**: A device that provides services, data, or processing power to clients, such as a web server, database server, or file server.

In a client-server architecture:

* The client initiates the request for service, data, or resources.
* The server receives and processes the request.
* The server then sends the requested information back to the client.

The key characteristics of client-server architecture are:

1. **Decoupling**: Clients and servers operate independently, with minimal dependencies on each other.
2. **Asynchronous communication**: Clients and servers communicate asynchronously, meaning that the client may not wait for a response before continuing its task.
3. **Resource sharing**: Servers provide resources to multiple clients simultaneously.

Types of Client-Server Architectures:

1. **Stateless Client-Server Architecture**: The server does not store any information about the client or their session state.
2. **Stateful Client-Server Architecture**: The server stores information about the client and their session state.

Benefits of Client-Server Architecture:

1. **Scalability**: Clients can be added or removed as needed, without affecting the server's performance.
2. **Flexibility**: Clients and servers can be deployed on different devices and platforms.
3. **Fault tolerance**: If one server fails, clients can connect to another server.

Common applications of Client-Server Architecture include:

1. Web browsing (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Email services
3. Online banking and financial transactions
4. E-commerce platforms
5. Social media and online communities

In summary, client-server architecture is a design pattern that allows for efficient distribution of resources and tasks between devices, enabling scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance in various applications.
